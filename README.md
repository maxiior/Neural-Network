# Neural-Network

An application that allows you to create a neural network with a selected number of layers and neurons. It was created primarily for learning to recognize numbers in pictures. The application uses backpropagation as a form of learning.

In the "examples" folder there are networks with a given level (in percent) of training.

In the "data" folder there are examples of handwritten numbers on the pictures, which you can use for training the neural network.
